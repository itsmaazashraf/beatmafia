# PROJECT INFORMATION

A mobile app that offers streaming and offline access to music and podcasts produced in Angola.

# REQUIREMENTS

Develop a mobile app that allows users to stream angolan music and podcasts for free. Allow users to download the songs to their phones to listen to the content whenever they are offline. Create an innovative market place for independent artists to share their music and podcasts. Use node.js and PostgreSQL for backend development. Use React Native for mobile app development. Ensure the app is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Allow users to accumulate points that can be used to download content for offline listening

# SOLUTIONS

Our team developed the Beat Mafia app using React Native for the frontend and node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend. We designed the app to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with a simple and intuitive interface. We created a marketplace for independent artists to share their music and podcasts with users, allowing them to reach a wider audience and connect with fans. To enable offline listening, we developed a points system that users can accumulate by engaging with the app, such as sharing content or referring friends, and then use to download songs to their devices. We tested the app extensively to ensure it was reliable and bug-free, and made sure it was compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

# RESULTS

Beat Mafia has been well-received by users in Angola and beyond, with many praising the app's user-friendly interface and innovative marketplace.
Independent artists have also found the app to be a valuable platform for sharing their music and podcasts with a wider audience. The points system has proven to be effective in encouraging user engagement and increasing app usage. Our team continues to update and improve the app, ensuring that it remains a top destination for angolan music and podcast lovers.
